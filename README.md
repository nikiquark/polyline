# Technical Task No. 1

A polyline in 3D is given by the list of nodesâ€™ coordinates. Implement an algorithm that
searches the nearest point on the polyline to any given point. In case of multiple solutions,
output all of them.

A detailed description is available [here](docs/task.pdf).   
A detailed documentation is available [here](docs/README.md). 

This instruction was tested on Windows11, it could slightly differ for other systems.
